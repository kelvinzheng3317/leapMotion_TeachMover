The leap code uses the leapc_python_binding repo to enable coding with Leap Motion in python, getting this repo to work involves running the following commands:
```
# Create and activate a virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e leapc-python-api
```

Not all code is written by me, aka any file that starts with leapC is not mine
